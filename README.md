# Election_Analysis
For this project I will be assisting in an election audit of the tabulated results for a U.S. congressional precinct in Colorado. We will be reporting the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote using Python.

## Purpose of using Python -
Once the coe is written and checked for efficacy we can automate the process and use it for not just congressional but Senatorial district and local elections too.

### Overview of Election Audit -
Our final code should be able to deliver the following information when the script is run: 
- Total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- Total number of votes each candidate received
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

#### Election Audit Results - 
Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 369,711

Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
-------------------------
Largest County Turnout: Arapahoe
-------------------------
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
-------------------------
Winner: Diana DeGette
Winning Vote Count: 272,892
Winning Percentage: 73.8%

##### Election Audit Summary -
This python code has made it easier to automate the otherwise very lengthy process of counting the votes. This can be used for other elections by just making few tweaks to the code. The key information can be changed based on the requirement. Counties can be switched to districts in case of Senatorial district elections. By simply changing few key values in the code we can use this code for any election.
